## Task 2: Implement localStorage service with loadData, saveData, generateId

Completed: 2026-01-16

### Changes:
- Added Storage service to index.html with:
  - `generateId()`: Creates unique IDs using timestamp + random string (format: `id-{timestamp36}-{random9}`)
  - `loadData()`: Loads bookmark data from localStorage, initializes with sample data if empty
  - `saveData(data)`: Persists bookmark data to localStorage with error handling
  - `STORAGE_KEY` constant for localStorage key ('bookmarks-data')
  - `SAMPLE_DATA` with 3 groups (Development, Social, News) and 6 sample bookmarks

- Sample bookmarks include:
  - Development: GitHub, Stack Overflow, MDN Web Docs
  - Social: Twitter, Reddit
  - News: Hacker News

- Updated App.init() to load data on startup

- Added 20 new tests covering:
  - generateId(): uniqueness, format, length
  - saveData(): localStorage persistence, overwriting
  - loadData(): retrieval, sample data initialization, error handling
  - Sample data structure validation

### Test Results:
- 42 tests passed (22 existing + 20 new)
- Linting passed with no errors

## Task 3: Build bookmark rendering with groups and favicons

Completed: 2026-01-16

### Changes:
- Added Renderer object to index.html with:
  - `getFaviconUrl(url)`: Generates Google favicon service URL from bookmark URL
    - Extracts hostname from URL
    - Returns fallback for invalid URLs
  - `createBookmarkElement(bookmark)`: Creates DOM element for a bookmark
    - Anchor element with href, target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer"
    - Favicon image with lazy loading
    - Title span with text overflow ellipsis
    - Edit/Delete action buttons with data attributes
  - `createGroupElement(group)`: Creates DOM element for a group card
    - Group header with title and edit/delete buttons
    - Bookmarks list sorted by order
    - Empty state message when no bookmarks
  - `render(data)`: Renders all groups to the container
    - Clears container before rendering
    - Sorts groups by order
    - Shows empty state when no groups or null data

- Updated App.init() to call Renderer.render() after loading data
- Exposed Renderer to window for testing

### Test Results:
- 70 tests passed (42 existing + 28 new)
- Linting passed with no errors

### New Tests Added:
- getFaviconUrl: 4 tests (valid URL, URL with path, subdomain, invalid URL)
- createBookmarkElement: 9 tests (element type, href, class, target/rel, data-id, favicon, lazy loading, title, actions)
- createGroupElement: 8 tests (element type, class, data-id, header/title, actions, bookmarks list, sort order, empty state)
- render: 7 tests (renders groups, sort order, bookmarks, empty states, clears container, favicons)

## Task 4: Add "New Bookmark" modal with form fields and URL validation

Completed: 2026-01-16

### Changes:
- Added BookmarkModal object to index.html with:
  - `init()`: Initializes modal references and binds event handlers
  - `bindEvents()`: Sets up click handlers for add button, cancel button, overlay click, and form submit
  - `isValidUrl(urlString)`: Validates URL format (must be http:// or https://)
  - `populateGroups(data, selectedGroupId)`: Populates group selector dropdown with available groups
  - `open(groupId)`: Opens modal for adding new bookmark, optionally pre-selecting a group
  - `close()`: Closes modal and resets form state
  - `handleSubmit(e)`: Handles form submission with validation, creates bookmark, saves to localStorage

- Features implemented:
  - URL validation: Only allows http:// and https:// protocols
  - Group selector: Dynamically populated from available groups
  - Auto-assigns order value to new bookmarks (max order + 1)
  - Unique ID generation for each bookmark
  - Data persistence: Saves to localStorage after adding
  - Re-renders groups after successful save
  - Modal closes on: cancel button, overlay click, successful submission

- Updated App.init() to initialize BookmarkModal
- Exposed BookmarkModal and App to window for testing

### Test Results:
- 106 tests passed (70 existing + 36 new)
- Linting passed with no errors

### New Tests Added:

- open: 6 tests (active class, modal title, clears fields, clears id, populates groups, pre-selects group)
- close: 2 tests (removes active class, resets form)
- handleSubmit: 9 tests (creates bookmark, correct order, unique ID, saves to localStorage, closes modal, invalid URL rejection, trims whitespace, correct group)
- event bindings: 4 tests (cancel closes, overlay closes, inside click doesn't close, add button opens)

## Task 5: Add "New Group" functionality with inline name input

Completed: 2026-01-16

### Changes:

  - `open()`: Opens modal for adding new group, clears form, focuses name input
  - `close()`: Closes modal and resets form state
  - `handleSubmit(e)`: Handles form submission with validation, creates group, saves to localStorage

- Features implemented:
  - Name validation: Rejects empty or whitespace-only names
  - Trims whitespace from group name before saving
  - Auto-assigns order value to new groups (max order + 1)
  - Handles edge case when no groups exist (order starts at 0)
  - Unique ID generation for each group
  - New groups created with empty bookmarks array
  - Data persistence: Saves to localStorage after adding
  - Re-renders groups after successful save
  - Modal closes on: cancel button, overlay click, successful submission
